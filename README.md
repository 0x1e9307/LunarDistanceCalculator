## LunarDistanceCalculator

This Python script calculates the distance between two points on the Moon's surface using the haversine formula.
The script was written in 5 minutes while I was searching the web for online calculators, so don't expect anything special from it.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Quick Start

```console
   git clone https://github.com/0x1e9307/LunarDistanceCalculator.git
   cd LunarDistanceCalculator
   python3 LunarDistanceCalc.py
```

Follow the prompts to enter the coordinates.

## Example

We need to find the distance from Theophilus crater to the landing site of the Apollo 16 module.

```console
	Enter coordinates in the format 'valueÂ° N/S/E/W'.
	Longitude of the first point: 11.4 S
	Latitude of the first point: 26.4 E
	Longitude of the second point: 8.9734 S
	Latitude of the second point: 15.5011 E

```
The output will be:

```console
	Coordinates entered: (-11.4, 26.4), (-8.9734, 15.5011)
	Distance between the points: 337.529199 km
```
